# Lemur Transition Guide: MIDI Kinetics FAQ

1. **JazzMutant Lemur Hardware Device**:  

   The original JazzMutant Lemur hardware device was discontinued in 2010. MIDI Kinetics does not support this device and has no relation to the former developer. Projects created with the Lemur app from either liine or MIDI Kinetics are not compatible with this hardware due to significant changes in the underlying architecture.

2. **Upgrading iOS or Deleting Liine's Lemur App**:  

   **Important**: Upgrading your iOS version or deleting the Lemur app developed by Liine from your iOS or Android device may make it unrecoverable, as it is no longer available on the App Store. To continue using Lemur, you will need to purchase the new version from MIDI Kinetics. 

3. **Purchasing the New Lemur App**:  

   Existing users of the Liine version of Lemur will need to purchase the app again from MIDI Kinetics. Unfortunately, the App Store does not allow license transfers between different versions or developers. 

4. **Owners of MIDI Kinetics Lemur Projects**:  

   If you owned any MIDI Kinetics bespoke products prior to the acquisition of Lemur, your account has been moved to [boutique.midikinetics.com](https://boutique.midikinetics.com). Your existing products will continue to work with the new version of Lemur and future updates and do not require repurchase.

    Existing Products:

    - Composer Tools Pro
    - C_brains
    - MKTransport

5. **Android Support**:  

   The initial re-release of Lemur is iOS-only. Android support is planned for 2025.

6. **Discontinued Support for 32-bit iOS Devices**:  

   Lemur no longer supports 32-bit iOS devices. The minimum iOS version required for Lemur is now iOS 13.6. For the latest system requirements, please visit the MIDI Kinetics website. 


7. **Lemur Community Forum**:  

   The community forum is expected to be back up by the end of 2024. In the meantime, you can visit Liine's old forum at [http://forum.liine.net/](http://forum.liine.net/). Please note that we are not affiliated with Liine, and we do not know when they might take this site down.
