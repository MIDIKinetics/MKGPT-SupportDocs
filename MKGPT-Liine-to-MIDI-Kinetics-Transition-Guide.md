# Lemur Transition Guide: MIDI Kinetics FAQ

A guide for users transitioning from Liine Lemur to MIDI Kinetics.

1. **Lemur must be repurchased.**

Liine Lemur users must repurchase Lemur from MIDI Kinetics. The App Store does not allow license transfers between different companies’ versions.

2. **Updating iOS may remove Liine Lemur.**

Since Liine Lemur is no longer available in the App Store, it may be deleted from your device during an iOS update, without your consent.

*To keep using Liine Lemur without repurchasing, avoid updating your device’s OS.*

3. **Your projects remain compatible.**

Projects created with Liine Lemur will work with the MIDI Kinetics version.

4. **MIDI Kinetics Lemur controllers moved to boutique.midikinetics.com.**

If you owned MIDI Kinetics products before the Lemur acquisition, your account and products have been moved to [boutique.midikinetics.com](https://boutique.midikinetics.com). No repurchase is necessary.

   Affected products:
   - Composer Tools Pro
   - C_brains
   - MKTransport

5. **Android support is not yet available.**

The re-release of Lemur is iOS-only. Android support is planned for 2025.

6. **iOS 13.6 minimum. No support for 32-bit devices.**

Visit the MIDI Kinetics website for the latest system requirements.

7. **Forum moved to community.midikinetics.com.**

To regain access to your account, update your password at [community.midikinetics.com](https://community.midikinetics.com).  
   Liine's old forum is still available at [http://forum.liine.net/](http://forum.liine.net/), but we are not affiliated with Liine and do not know when the site will be taken down.

8. **JazzMutant hardware not supported.**

The original JazzMutant Lemur hardware, discontinued in 2010, is not supported. MIDI Kinetics is not associated with the former developer, and projects from the Lemur app are incompatible with this hardware due to major architecture changes.
