# MKGPT-SupportDocs

This repository contains the training data used for the MKGPT Support Bot. When using the Support Bot, if it can't seem to answer the question correctly, pointing it to this repository can often help give it the extra push it needs.

This is also a great place to get general technical support, as it is quite likely your question has an answer here.

For example:
- **MKGPT-Getting-Started-With-Lemur**  
  A quick tutorial on how to get started with Lemur.

- **MKGPT-LemurLang-Programming-Guide**  
  Contains a complete specification of the Lemur programming language, LemurLang.
  
- **MKGPT-Lemur-UI-Programming-Guide**  
  Contains a detailed description of core principles in building Lemur UIs.
  
- **MKGPT-Lemur-MIDI-Programming-Guide**
